Hello, this repository is dedicated to my attempts at freeCodeCamp's Certification Project 1 for the Responsive Web Design path. I'm an aspiring software/web developer, 
and I'm building up and honing my skills through freeCodeCamp. I'm a lifelong learner, any advice/comments/constructive criticism is appreciated. 
Thank you for reading.
