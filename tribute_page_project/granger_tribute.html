      Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone-</span>
      During her first day at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she was sorted into Gryffindor house. While there, she befriended Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley, both of them would end up becoming her closest friends. Towards the end of the book, she and Ron helped Harry overcome magical barriers set by the professors at Hogwarts to reach the Mirror of Erised in the basement. She uses logic to deduce the correct potions to drink. She helps Gryffindor earn 50 house points which contributes towards Gryffindor winning the House Cup.

        <span class="bold">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets- </span>In her second year at Hogwarts, the school is confronted with a lurking mystery that has returned after decades: the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, supposedly by the Heir of Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. The heir of Slytherin unleashed Slytherin's monster from within the chamber to purge the school of Muggle-borns. She was distressed when Harry Potter was able to hear the voice of the monster through the walls at school. She managed to figure out the monster of Slytherin was in fact, a basilisk, the king of serpents, and that it was manoeuvering to different parts of Hogwarts through the sewers. Unfortunately, she indirectly made eye contact with the basilisk through her mirror, and thus she was "petrified", and turned into stone. Afterwards, she was revived using Mandrake Restorative juice.

        While at Diagon Alley with the Weasleys and Harry, she adopted a cat, which she named Crookshanks. At the beginning of her third year at Hogwarts, she obtained a Time-Turner from Professor McGonagall so she could attend all of her classes. Later that year, using her Time-Turner, she and Harry saved Rubeus Hagrid's hippogriff, Buckbeak from being executed.

        <span class="bold">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire- </span>In her fourth year at Hogwarts, she taught Harry Potter several useful spells to help him prepare for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. She was also used as a "hostage" to be saved by Viktor Krum during the second task of the tournament. Later, she also discovered that Rita Skeeter, the author of the Daily Prophet, was an unregistered Animagus (in the form of a beetle), which enabled her to listen in on private conversations that took place between Hermione and her friends.

In her fifth year at Hogwarts, she was appointed a prefect for Gryffindor house. She took her position very seriously. She, Harry and Ron founded Dumbledore's Army, a secret organisation dedicated to teaching students practical defensive spells during after school hours. She created coins enchanted with the Protean Charm as means of communication between members of Dumbledore's Army. She learned how to conjure a Patronus charm (in the form of an otter) from Harry during one of the sessions. She also took her O.W.L exams during this school year (she ended up scoring "Outstanding" for all subjects except Defence Against the Dark Arts, in which she scored "Exceeds Expectations"). She took part in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic. She was critically injured by Antonin Dolohov during the battle, but made a full recovery afterwards.

In her sixth year, she received her O.W.L results: 9 "Outstandings", and one "Exceeds Expectations" in Defence Against the Dark Arts. By this time, she'd developed romantic feelings for Ron. According to Harry, they were on their way to a romantic relationship sooner or later. However, her friendship with Ron was strained when he chose to go out with Lavender Brown to get back at Harry and her for being invited to join the "Slug Club". She attacked him with a flock of birds for his insensitivity towards her feelings. They reconciled afterwards when Ron fell ill after consuming poisoned mead, which worried her greatly. Afterwards, she took part in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. After Dumbledore's funeral, she promised Harry that she would forgo her final year at Hogwarts to help him hunt down Voldemort's Horcruxes.

        <span class="bold">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- </span>
She began planning for her journey with Harry and Ron immediately after the events in the Half-Blood Prince. She altered her parents' memories and sent them to Australia. She took part in the operation to rescue Harry Potter from 4 Privet Drive, where she disguised herself as Harry Potter with the help of Polyjuice Potion to confuse Voldemort's army, the Death Eaters. She was escorted by Kingsley Shacklebolt, and fought off several Death Eaters on their way to the Weasleys' house. At Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the trio escape to Tottenham Court Road after they were informed of the collapse of the Ministry of Magic. They duelled Dolohov and Rowle while there. She wiped both of their memories to throw them off their track. She, along with Harry and Ron infiltrated the Ministry of Magic by disguising themselves as Ministry officials. Not long after, she, along with Harry and Ron were captured by Snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor. She was tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange. Fortunately, Dobby showed up and helped them escape to Shell Cottage. Afterwards, the trio, with the help of Griphook, broke into Lestrange's Gringotts vault and stole Helga Hufflepuff's cup, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. They returned to Hogwarts to search for Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem, and to fight Voldemort's army. While Harry went to search for the diadem, she and Ron went to the Chamber of Secrets to retrieve basilisk fangs to destroy the cup. After that, both of them head to the Room of Requirement to help Harry search for the diadem, but they were ambushed by Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle. The trio managed to destroy the diadem and escape. At the final battle inside Hogwarts grounds, she duelled Lestrange but was unable to kill her (which Molly Weasley later did). She witnessed the final duel between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort, where Harry vanquished the Dark Lord for the final time.
