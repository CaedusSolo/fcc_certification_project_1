      <h2>Our Courses</h2>
      <ul class="courses-list">
        <li class="course-title">Responsive Web Design Certification Course</li>
  <p>In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.</p>

<p>First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>build and design a (somewhat) functional website</li>
      <li>use features in CSS such as flexbox and grid effectively</li>
      <li>familiarise yourself with web development concepts and the process of web development</li>
      <li>develop the mindset and thinking of a web developer</li>
      </ul>
      <li class="course-title">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification Course
        </li>
        <p>While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.</p>

<p>Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).
</p>
<li class="course-title">Front End Development Libraries Course</li>
<p>Now that you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, level up your skills by learning some of the most popular front end libraries in the industry.</p>

<p>In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, you'll learn how to style your site quickly with Bootstrap. You'll also learn how to add logic to your CSS styles and extend them with Sass.</p>

<p>Later, you'll build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux.
</p>
<li class="course-title">Data Visualisation Course</li>
<p>Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.</p>
<p>In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build charts, graphs, and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.</p>
<p>You'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface).

      <h2>Why Choose freeCodeCamp As Your Number One Platform to Learn Coding?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="feature-title">It's free!</li><p class="feature-explanation">Everything on freeCodeCamp is free of charge. You do not need to pay a single dollar to access our resources (although donations are much, much appreciated).</p>
        <li class="feature-title">Our Courses Are 100% Project-Based!</li>
        <p class="feature-explanation">No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one
          test at a time, as you build up a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.</p>
<li class="feature-title">Industry-Ready Courses</li>
<p class="feature-explanation">freeCodeCamp alumni from all over the world have gotten jobs at many well-known companies such as Google, YouTube and Facebook. freeCodeCamp provides a solid foundation for aspiring software developers to get started in their programming journey.</p>
